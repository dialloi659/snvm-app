## Why use SNVM? <a name="why-use-snvm"></a>

Managing Node.js versions can prove to be complex, particularly when you are working simultaneously on multiple projects with different version requirements. Moreover, frameworks like Angular might require specific versions of Node.js to function correctly. SNVM facilitates managing these complexities by allowing you to easily switch between Node.js versions.

## Comparison between SNVM and NVM <a name="comparison-between-snvm-and-nvm"></a>

SNVM stands out from NVM, a popular Node.js version management tool, on several key aspects:

- **Installation:** SNVM, being a portable application, requires no installation. Simply execute the .exe file to start using it, unlike NVM which can present installation and configuration challenges on Windows.
- **Admin rights management:** SNVM does not require administrative rights to be executed, which can be a major advantage for developers who do not have these rights on their work machines.
- **Ease of use:** SNVM provides an intuitive user interface, allowing easy switching of Node.js versions without having to type specific commands.

## Installing SNVM <a name="installing-snvm"></a>

As SNVM is a portable application, no installation is needed. However, an installable version is also available for those who prefer a local installation.

**Portable Version:** Download the SNVM executable, then simply execute it.

2. Extract the contents of the zip file into a specific folder of your choice.
3. Open the SNVM configuration file and add the path to the folder where you extracted Node.js.
